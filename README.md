# Mega-Capturers-MC-1.12.2
Minecraft PVP map for 1.12.2 (Very old and a bit unpolished)

Disclaimer: I am HXadow (one of my many names...)

This Map was made by me and Hexa (LucasPatricio3 [also known as Hexa] on github, check him out!) as a fun project.

The map comes loaded with 2 game-modes (Tower Capture and Team Deathmatch) with 2 different maps (Village and Desert) and as well as 7 playable characters with custom abilities.

To select a character simply walk over the character display.
To use (most) abilities you must drop the item (this is all explained in detail in the character's book) and the ability will activate.
The red and blue areas on the lobby are used to select a team (if the game is seemingly frozen simply use    */scoreboard players set START start 500*    to reset the score and timer, or   */scoreboard players set RED SCORES 10000*)
There is also an available test area where the credits are, opposite to the character select area, and a chill hub area.

Enjoy!
