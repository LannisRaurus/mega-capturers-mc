# Overview
`Minecraft PVP map for 1.12.2` (Very old and a bit unpolished, still fun to play with friends!)
Disclaimer: I am HXadow (one of my many names...)
This Map was made by me and Hexa (`LucasPatricio3` \[also known as Hexa\] on github, check him out!) as a fun project.
# Useful commands
Set the start score (decreases until zero -> game starts) \[glass doors are closed for START = 0\]:
```
/scoreboard players set START start X
```
Set the scores of a team (usually to force end a match):
```
/scoreboard players set RED SCORES 10000
```
# Gamemodes - Tower Capture
The tower capture gamemode consists of capturing three towers; Each time you capture your Team's score increases; kills also contribute to the score; upon capturing all points, your score starts steadily increasing, and the game ends at a score of 10000.

# Gamemodes - Team Deathmatch
This gamemode consists in pure violence, rage and combat! The only objective is to kill enemies and reach 10000 score. The map is different:

# Characters
The mechanics for the characters are all similar - pressing `Q` with an ability selected to use it (besides potions and GApple).
All the character information is documented in the character's handbook (to select a character simply go over the pod in the lobby)
