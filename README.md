# Overview
Minecraft PVP map for 1.12.2 (Very old and a bit unpolished, still fun to play with friends!)
Disclaimer: I am HXadow (one of my many names...)
This Map was made by me and Hexa (`LucasPatricio3` \[also known as Hexa\] on github, check him out!) as a fun project.
#Useful commands
Set the start score (decreases until zero -> game starts) \[glass doors are closed for START = 0\]:
```
/scoreboard players set START start X
```
Set the scores of a team (usually to force end a match):
```
/scoreboard players set RED SCORES 10000
```
#Gamemodes - Tower Capture
The tower capture gamemode consists of capturing three towers; Each time you capture your Team's score increases; kills also contribute to the score; upon capturing all points, your score starts steadily increasing, and the game ends at a score of 10000.
